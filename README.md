# network-flow-model
Contains code used in the analysis of the project on modeling flow distribution in a bipartite flow network

## graphing+numerical_sol.py
Contains code for
1. Graphing log10(data/model) for specific networks (toggle line 199)
2. Generating MaxEnt model flow rates through numerial solution of Eq. 6ab (toggle line 200); stored in file "log10_data_model.txt"
3. Generating random networks with the same topology and aggregate flow rates as the Glen Canyon network (toggle line 201); values of Diatom-Simuliidae pair are stored in file "glen_diat_simul_random.txt"
